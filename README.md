# truolingo

## what is it?
Truolingo is a classic Duolingo creepypasta with its own OST and lore. The format for now is unknown but it will probably not be gory or bloody or anything like that.

It wont be a slow descent into madness and horror.

There are two endings planned so far: Good and Bad endings.

## what is it made of?
Truolingo is python-based, using tkinter and pygame for the base functionality. It uses Ogg Vorbis (.ogg) files for every sound included (see assets/ogg). For preservation purposes, the non-ogg
formats are also stored.

These will be removed in the final releases.

## who is Truo?
Truo is a light blue owl, unlike Duo, who is green. I know the icon is green, but that's for the **L O R E**. Will be explained in game later on.
### is Duo in this game?
Only one ending does Duo end up being visible. He might not look so good, though.

## anything else?
Nope.
